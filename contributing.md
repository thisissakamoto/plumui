## Project Architecture

Plum UI v0.x builds upon two key projects in our ecosystem:

- **Ark UI** - Component foundation
- **Zag.js** - Logic and accessibility engine

Our philosophy is to minimize code duplication by leveraging these specialized libraries whenever possible.

### Where to File Issues

**For logic or accessibility bugs:**
→ Likely a Zag.js issue → Report in the [Zag.js repository](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag)

**For styling or theming problems:**
→ Can be fixed directly in Plum UI → Report here

### Where to Request Features

**New components without complex logic:**
→ Suitable for Plum UI or Ark UI → Start a discussion in [this repository](https://github.com/ark-ui)

**New components requiring complex logic/interactions:**
→ Belongs in Zag.js → Start a discussion in the [Zag.js repository](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag)

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
   ```
